            <p align = justify><b>Lorem Ipsum</b> <i>is simply dummy text</i> of the <tt>printing</tt> and typesetting industry.
                Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
                when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
                <em>It has survived not only five centuries</em>, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
                remaining essentially unchanged. <br> It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
                <font size=5>Lorem Ipsum</font> passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including
                versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
